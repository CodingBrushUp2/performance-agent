# Performance Agent

Evidence-driven performance engineering for .NET developers and coding agents.

Performance Agent measures first and explains second. Its core workflow works without an LLM; optional AI can help plan experiments and interpret evidence, but benchmark measurements remain the source of truth.

> Project status: early design / V1 bootstrap. The repository name is temporary and is not the final product brand.

## V1 direction

- Local-first CLI
- BenchmarkDotNet as the first measurement adapter
- Baseline vs candidate comparison
- Regression/performance-budget checks
- JSON and Markdown evidence reports
- Optional AI analysis through a provider abstraction

See [Product Specification](docs/product-spec.md) and [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

## Non-goals for V1

No hosted dashboard, accounts, database, IDE extension, distributed runners, or mandatory cloud service.
